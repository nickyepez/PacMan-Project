# PacMan-Project
Description: As the webpage loads PacMan will start moving from left to right across the browser window. As soon as Pacman reaches the left or right edge of the browser window, it will turn to the opposite direction. If browser window is resized, the browser will need to be refreshed in order for PacMan to properly recogninize the "new" browser window edges.
